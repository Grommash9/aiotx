Blockchain monitoring
=====================

AioTx provides functionality to monitor new blocks and transactions on the blockchain. It allows you to register handlers that will be called when new blocks or transactions are detected.

Now it's working and checked for ETH, BSC, BTC, LTC, TRON, POLYGON, TON.

Registering Handlers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can register handlers for blocks, transactions, and block transactions using the `on_block`, `on_transaction`, and `on_block_transactions` decorators provided by the `monitor` attribute of the client instance.

Block Handler
"""""""""""""

To register a block handler, use the `@client.monitor.on_block` decorator. The decorated function should accept a single parameter representing the block number. Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

    @bsc_client.monitor.on_block
    async def handle_block(block):
        print("Block:", block)

For EVM based client we now have cur_block (we are on that block) and last network block so we can know how far are we from sync:

.. code-block:: python

    @bsc_client.monitor.on_block
    async def handle_block(cur_block, latest_block):
        print("Block:", cur_block, "last:", latest_block)


Transaction Handler
"""""""""""""""""""

To register a transaction handler, use the `@client.monitor.on_transaction` decorator. The decorated function should accept a single parameter representing the transaction details. Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

    @bsc_client.monitor.on_transaction
    async def handle_transaction(transaction):
        print("Transaction:", transaction)

Block Transactions Handler
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To register a block transactions handler, use the `@client.monitor.on_block_transactions` decorator. The decorated function should accept a single parameter representing a list of transactions in the block. Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

    @bsc_client.monitor.on_block_transactions
    async def handle_block_transactions(transactions):
        print("Block transactions:", transactions)

Note: For TON, this handler will be triggered multiple times for each master block, as it processes shard transactions separately. For EVM-based clients, this handler will be triggered once per block and will include decoded transaction input.

Starting and Stopping Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To start monitoring, you can use the `start_monitoring` method of the client instance. 

You can optionally specify the starting block number from which to begin monitoring. 

If no starting block is provided, monitoring will start from the latest block.

You can also use the `timeout_between_blocks` param to choose how much time monitoring should wait to try get new block.
For BTC, for example, we can wait 5-10 seconds and it's fine, but for TON we should wait <1 second.

In TON, `timeout_between_blocks` will also be used as timeout between getting shards for master block to prevent 429 error.

`timeout_between_blocks` is optional and set to 1 second by default.

    - **monitoring_start_block** (int, optional): Block number from which to begin monitoring.
    - **timeout_between_blocks** (int, optional): How many seconds monitoring should wait to try get new block.

.. code-block:: python

    await bsc_client.start_monitoring(
        monitoring_start_block=584, 
        timeout_between_blocks=2)

To stop monitoring, you can use the `stop_monitoring` method.

.. code-block:: python

    bsc_client.stop_monitoring()

Monitoring Multiple Clients
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can monitor multiple instances simultaneously by creating separate instances and registering handlers for each one. Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

    from aiotx.clients import AioTxBSCClient, AioTxETHClient
    import asyncio

    bsc_client = AioTxBSCClient("NODE_URL", 97)
    eth_client = AioTxETHClient("NODE_URL", 1151511)

    @bsc_client.monitor.on_block
    async def handle_block(block):
        print("bsc_client: block", block)

    @bsc_client.monitor.on_transaction
    async def handle_transaction(transaction):
        print("bsc_client: transaction", transaction)

    @bsc_client.monitor.on_block_transactions
    async def handle_block_transactions(transactions):
        print("bsc_client: block transactions", transactions)

    @eth_client.monitor.on_block
    async def handle_block(block):
        print("eth_client: block", block)

    @eth_client.monitor.on_transaction
    async def handle_transaction(transaction):
        print("eth_client: transaction", transaction)

    @eth_client.monitor.on_block_transactions
    async def handle_block_transactions(transactions):
        print("eth_client: block transactions", transactions)

    async def main():
        bsc_task = asyncio.create_task(bsc_client.start_monitoring())
        eth_task = asyncio.create_task(eth_client.start_monitoring())
        await asyncio.gather(bsc_task, eth_task)

        try:
            while True:
                await asyncio.sleep(1)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            bsc_client.stop_monitoring()
            eth_client.stop_monitoring()


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())

Integration with Aiogram
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can integrate the monitoring functionality with the Aiogram library to send notifications or perform actions based on the received blocks and transactions. Here's an example:

.. code-block:: python

    from aiogram import Bot, Dispatcher
    from aiotx.clients import AioTxBSCClient

    bot = Bot(token="BOT_TOKEN")
    dispatcher = Dispatcher()
    bsc_client = AioTxBSCClient("NODE_URL", 97)

    @bsc_client.monitor.on_block
    async def handle_block(block):
        block_number = block
        chat_id = "CHAT_ID"
        message = f"New block: {block_number}"
        await bot.send_message(chat_id=chat_id, text=message)

    async def main():
        monitoring_task = asyncio.create_task(bsc_client.start_monitoring())
        await asyncio.gather(monitoring_task, dispatcher.start_polling(bot))

    asyncio.run(main())

In this example, the `handle_block` function is called whenever a new block is received. It sends a message to the specified chat ID using the Aiogram bot.

These examples demonstrate different ways to utilize the monitoring functionality provided by AioTx clients. You can customize the handlers and integrate monitoring into your application based on your specific requirements.

Monitoring TON Blockchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To monitor the TON blockchain, you need to create an instance of `AioTxTONClient` and use the `TonMonitor` class to start monitoring.

.. code-block:: python

    from aiotx.clients import AioTxTONClient
    import asyncio

    ton_client = AioTxTONClient("https://go.getblock.io/<token>")

    @ton_client.monitor.on_block
    async def handle_block(block):
        # Process the master block
        print("ton_client: block", block)

    @ton_client.monitor.on_transaction
    async def handle_transaction(transaction):
        # Process the transaction
        print("ton_client: transaction", transaction)

    @ton_client.monitor.on_block_transactions
    async def handle_block_transactions(transactions):
        # Process all transactions in a shard
        print("ton_client: shard transactions", transactions)

    async def main():
        await ton_client.start_monitoring()
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(1)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        asyncio.run(main())

Output:

.. code-block:: text

    ton_client: transaction {'@type': 'blocks.shortTxId', 'mode': 135, 'account': '0:ffbd85ffba92089f5263a510ae89b7a8b0bc8bbea7c76102fb7154a4e84de04b', 'lt': '46762307000001', 'hash': 'uXqQz3LEJjor09cIcZ4IoRQX+IGuVnjBR1zQzut1tKY='}
    ton_client: block 38104588
    ton_client: shard transactions [...]

In this example, we create an instance of `AioTxTONClient` with the appropriate API endpoint. We then register handlers for blocks, transactions, and block transactions using the `on_block`, `on_transaction`, and `on_block_transactions` decorators, respectively.

Inside the `handle_block` handler, you can process the master block as needed. The `block` parameter contains the block data.

Inside the `handle_transaction` handler, you can process each transaction encountered. The `transaction` parameter contains basic transaction information such as the account address, logical time, and transaction hash.

The `handle_block_transactions` handler receives a list of transactions for each shard. Note that for TON, this handler will be triggered multiple times for each master block, as it processes shard transactions separately.

By default, the transaction details are not fetched for every transaction to avoid consuming a large number of API calls. If you want to retrieve more details about a specific transaction, you can use the `get_transactions` method of `AioTxTONClient`, as shown in the example:

.. code-block:: python

    tx_details = await ton_client.get_transactions(
        "0:ffbd85ffba92089f5263a510ae89b7a8b0bc8bbea7c76102fb7154a4e84de04b",
        1, 46762307000001, "uXqQz3LEJjor09cIcZ4IoRQX+IGuVnjBR1zQzut1tKY=")

This allows you to selectively fetch transaction details for the transactions you are interested in.

Finally, the `main` function starts the monitoring process by calling `start_monitoring` on the `ton_client` instance. It then enters a loop to keep the script running and allow the monitoring to continue.

Note: Make sure to replace `<token>` in the API endpoint with your actual API token.

With this setup, you can monitor the TON blockchain, handle blocks, transactions, and shard transactions, and selectively fetch transaction details as needed.

EVM-based Clients (ETH, BSC, etc.)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For EVM-based clients (such as Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain), the `on_block_transactions` handler will be triggered once per block. The transactions in the handler will include decoded input, similar to the `on_transaction` handler. This allows for efficient processing of all transactions in a block with their decoded inputs.

.. code-block:: python

    @eth_client.monitor.on_block_transactions
    async def handle_block_transactions(transactions):
        for tx in transactions:
            print("Transaction hash:", tx['hash'])
            print("Decoded input:", tx['aiotx_decoded_input'])
