TON client
==========

Introduction
------------

The TON (The Open Network) Client is a powerful tool for interacting with the TON blockchain. It provides a seamless way to connect to the TON network, perform various operations, and monitor blockchain activities.

The TON Client supports the TON cryptocurrency and offers a range of functionalities, including wallet creation, balance retrieval, transaction history, and sending transactions.

QuickStart
----------

To create an instance of `AioTxTONClient`, you need to provide the following parameters:

    - **node_url**: The URL of the node to connect to.
    - **headers** (dict, optional): The list of headers what will be used for interactions with node


Here's an example:


.. code-block:: python

      from aiotx.clients import AioTxTONClient
      import asyncio

      async def main():
         ton_client = AioTxTONClient(
            "https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2",
            headers={"X-API-Key": "GET API KEY FROM https://t.me/tonapibot"},
   )

      # Create a new wallet
      memo, address, raw_address = await ton_client.generate_address()
      print("New wallet address:", address)

      # Get wallet balance
      balance = await ton_client.get_balance(address)
      print("Wallet balance:", ton_client.from_nano(balance, "ton"), "TON")

      # Get transaction history
      transactions = await ton_client.get_transactions(address, limit=10)
      print("Recent transactions:")
      for tx in transactions:
         print("  - Transaction ID:", tx["transaction_id"]["hash"])
         print("    Amount:", ton_client.from_nano(int(tx["in_msg"]["value"]), "ton"), "TON")

      # Send TON
      to_address = "EQDvRVnNMFgg8Wc4UZqVb8lnsTrPVwdX0-mYu_SdPzt0dIWX"
      amount = ton_client.to_nano(1.5)  # 1.5 TON
      tx_hash = await ton_client.send(mnemonic, to_address, amount)
      print("Transaction sent. Hash:", tx_hash)

      #Bulk send
      # Create a TON client with HighloadWalletV2Contract

      ton_client = AioTxTONClient(
         "https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2",
         headers={"X-API-Key": "GET API KEY FROM https://t.me/tonapibot"},
         wallet_version=WalletVersionEnum.hv2,
      )

      # Deploy the HighloadWalletV2Contract wallet (required before sending)
      tx_id = await bulk_ton_client.deploy_wallet("your mnemonic phrase here")
      
      # Send TON tokens to multiple recipients using the send_bulk method
      tx_id = await bulk_ton_client.send_bulk(
         "your mnemonic phrase here",
         recipients_list,
      )

   asyncio.run(main())

In this example, we create an instance of `AioTxTONClient` by providing the TON node URL. Make sure to replace `<token>` with your actual API token.

The code demonstrates the following operations:

1. Creating a new wallet by generating a mnemonic phrase and deriving the wallet address from it.
2. Retrieving the balance of the wallet using the `get_balance` method.
3. Fetching the recent transaction history of the wallet using the `get_transactions` method.
4. Sending TON to another address using the `send` method.

Blockchain Monitoring
---------------------

You can monitor the TON blockchain for new blocks and transactions in real-time. This feature is particularly useful for tracking specific addresses or detecting certain events.

For detailed information on how to set up and use blockchain monitoring with the TON Client, please refer to the :doc:`../../monitoring`.
